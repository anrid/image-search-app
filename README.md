- Material-UI :older_woman:
- Vercel (to host our demo) :suspect:

### Answers

- Do you have any strong rationale for why you chose specific development technologies for this project that you would like to share with the team?

  I love this particular combination of front-end tech.

  - Used pure _JavaScript_ to speed things up a bit. Don't get me wrong, I love TS, but _JS + ESLint_ felt more than adequate for this project.
  - _React_ is easy to use.
  - _Mobx State Tree_ feels more natural than Redux.
  - _Parcel_ just works! Can't say the same thing about Webpack.
  - _Styled Components_ are have completely changed how I build front-ends.
  - _Material-UI_ React components = awesome.
  - _Vercel_ is an amazing service. Super-easy to use.

- Do you have any strong rationale for why you made specific design decisions (software architecture design) over alternatives?

  Tried following standard best practices when it comes to folder structure, naming, etc.

  Haven't done front-end programming in a while, and boy do things **change fast!**

- Do you have any strong rationale for why you made specific implementation decisions over alternatives?

  Not really. There are only so many ways that this particular front-end stack can be used.
  
  I did try to keep things _as simple as possible_.

- What else would you like to improve if you have more time? This can be in simple format like a TODO bullet points.

  I'd finish the app according to the spec for starters!

### TODO

- [ ] Finish the app according to spec!

- [ ] Add tests.

- [ ] Polish, tweak, then polish some more.
